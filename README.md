# Whether the Weather is Good or Not

## Description

This repository was created so I could create a weather dashboard that will show the current weather, a 5 day forecast, and a list of previous searches. It also stores the last searched city in local storage so that when the user refreshes the page the search results of their last searched city are still there for them.

You can use the commits to follow my journey.



### How did I do it?

I used HTML to create the elements of the initial index.html page. I utilized Bootstrap and/or CSS to style all elements. And I used JavaScript, jQuery, Moment.js, and the OpenWeatherMap API to add event listeners, dynamically create more HTML elements, and access local storage.

If you wish to visit this website you can do so via this link: https://emmerz6949.github.io/whether-the-weather-is-good-or-not/ .



### Installation and Usage

There isn't anything to install as this is just a website that has been deployed.

To use this weather dashboard click on the link in the "How did I do it?" section of this README.md, once the website loads use the search input and button to search for a city to get the current weather and 5 day forecast for that city.
